Description of revision changes : (release date)

Version  1.2      (6-Feb-2011)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added IR (Image Rotation) parameter support.
* Added IJ (Image Justify) parameter support.
* Changed build process for GNU autotool built system.
  See INSTALL for instruction on compiling.
  The Windows 32bit executalbe is in separated archive, 
  gerb2tiff-{version}-win32-bin.zip
* removed redundant sub-minor version numbers    



Version  1.0.9      (20-Dec-2010)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* bug fix: Polygon drawing code completely rewritten. This fixed problems with 
  arcs and line mismatching. Also fixed the problem of occurring rouge horizontal 
  scan lines. 
* bug fix: Aperture primitive 21 (Line Centre) had centre position located at 
  upper left instead of lower left.
* Improved bitmap rendering speed.

Version  1.0.8      (8-Oct-2009)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* bug fix: fixed crash when multiple input gerber files specified.

Version  1.0.7      (3-Oct-2009)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* bug fixed: arcs with equal start and ending points were not drawn.

Version  1.0.6      (16-July-2009)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* bug fixed: The width of traces were incorrectly scaled to the square of the
  scale factor.
* bug fixed: IPNEG and IPPOS parameters were not being recognised.
* Implemented MI (Mirror Axis) parameter
* Implemented IF (Include File) parameter. note: nested includes are allowed, and 
  recursive includes are not safeguarded. Error reporting does not contain include 
  file information. These two problems can be fixed in future versions. 
* Arcs are now supported in polygon drawing
* Improved robustness in reading coordinate data. Can handle excess digits than 
  designated in FS parameter.
* Improved arc drawing algorithm yet again. Added correction mechanism for 
  mismatched arc centres in 360 degree circular mode. In single quadrant, arc 
  centres are always relative to the tool location prior to G03/G02 command, by an 
  offset given by I,J. In single quadrant mode arc radius = sqrt(I*I + J*J).
  Arc with zero radius are replaced with line segments. 
  (Gerber arcs are horrible to implement)  

Version  1.0.5      (10-July-2009)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* bug fixed: The last vertex in G36 command polygons was ignored. This caused 
  polygons that did not have the last vertex matching the first vertex to be drawn 
  incorrectly.
* bug fixed: An aperture change followed by any drawing within the same 
  command block would not draw the first line/arc correctly.
* bug fixed: Any command data block caused drawing to occur if the lamp state 
  was on. For example, the command block 'G37*' would draw to current X Y position
  if lamp was on. The correct method draws only if a command block 
  contains any one of the following commands: X, Y, I, J or D1 (lamp on) and is 
  not in polygon mode.     
* improved error reporting on macro definitions              


Version  1.0.4      (9-July-2009)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* bug fixed: Consecutive ADD data blocks were not recognised inside a single '%' block.              

Version  1.0.3      (4-July-2009)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* added options, --grow-mm, --boarder-pixels, --strip-rows
* verbose mode reports bitmap origin location.
* multiple Gerber files on command line are overlayed to a single bitmap.
  


Version  1.0.2      (22-June-2009)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed several bugs with arc drawing
* Added support linear line drawing using the standard Rectangle aperture.
* Added options for image scaling.
* Improved error reporting
* Improved command line interface.
* Capable of reading Gerber data form standard input

Version  1.0.0beta  (5-June-2009)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The project was renamed to gerb2tiff
* A complete rewrite of the source code. 
   The image is now rendered entirely by polygons
   Uses bison and flex for the parser
* Close to full implementation of the full RS-274X standard
* Improved speed and memory usage.  
 
Version  0.74  (19-October-2007)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* fixed problem with gerb2tif.exe dependencies. A quick fix was to 
include cygwin1.dll

Version  0.73  (19-October-2007)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* fixed small bug with TIFF library reporting an error   

Version  0.72  (9-Sept-2007)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* uses the LibTIFF library (fixed DPI bug in TIFF header and output is compressed) 

Version  0.71  ()
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* added %OF Image offset parameter

Version  0.70  (5th April 2007)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Multiple Gerber files on the command line are now superimposed to a single output. 
  The Gerber X,Y coordinates for each file are directly overlayed.
* Added option to add or subtract a given number of pixels width to outlines of 
  all apertures. 
* Fixed some other bugs.

 
Version  0.63  (uploaded 28th May 2004)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* bugs fixes 
  fixed program crash from Aperture Macro Circles AND Line Vectors printing 
  with non zero centre position


Version  0.62b  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* bugs fixes - initialised X,Y coordinates to zero at startup.
* less strict with RS-274X %FS parameter format. 


Version  0.62  (uploaded 14th April 2004)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* fixed bug with %IPNEG command
* Area information reports total area of positive pixels in bitmap (see readme.txt)


Version  0.61  (uploaded 12th April 2004)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* FS parameter defaults to %FSALX23Y23*% in spite of RS-274X not specifying defaults.
* fixed bug with Incremental Coordinate format.


Version  0.6  (uploaded 30th March 2004)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Support for incremental coordinates mode (untested !)

* Macro Aperture modifiers for Centre Position, Exposure State and Rotation now
  take effect.
* Support for Macro Apertures with multiple or combined primitives of the same
  macro name.
* Removed -S command line option for subtracting outline of shapes. Feature
  was not necessary and also had bugs.
* some bug fixes.


Version  0.5  (uploaded 26th March 2004)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added circular interpolation drawing features of the Gerber standard. Circular
  drawing commands G03, G02, G74, G75 are now recognised.
* Correctly implemented Macro Apertures with parameter passing of the modifier list.
  Previously version did not allow Macro Apertures modifier lists to be modified.
* Removed -a option and made area information always displayed.
* Added support for commands %MI, %IP.
* Added special aperture primitive number 21,  Line(Centre).
* More robust error checking during parsing, and other small improvements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed problem with rounding the size of apertures types Circle and Orbround.
  The bitmap image now represents a more accurate rounded size of these apertures.
* Added feature for subtracting a set number of pixels from the outline
  of all shapes drawn. Useful for correcting phototool trace width dimensions.
* Added detailed descriptions of command line options to readme.txt

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added support for Gerber command G04 - "Ignore Data Block"
* Displays total area of image in square centimetres, see -a option
* Optimised drawing routines to only draw outline pixels of the aperture
  shape that are dependent upon the direction movement. (plotting time is
  less than half)
* Corrected my email address in Readme.txt file.


Version  0.2  (uploaded on 4th April 2001)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The first release
